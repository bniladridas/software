## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/software.git
cd software

# Set up environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install together
pip install Flask==2.0.1 Werkzeug==2.0.1

# Create .env file with your API key
echo "TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Run the server
python simple_app.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5001 in your browser.

The server will start in debug mode and automatically reload when you make changes to the code. You should see output similar to:

```
INFO:__main__:Together API client initialized successfully
* Serving Flask app 'simple_app' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
* Debug mode: on
INFO:werkzeug: * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

To stop the server, press CTRL+C in the terminal.
